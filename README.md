## House Price Prediction Using ANN

1. Task involved with predicting whether the house price is above or below the median value.
2. Trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Keras and turned the model with best parameters.
3. Performed L2 regularization to reduce overfitting the model and achieved accuracy of 91.78%.

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib 
4. Seaborn
5. Keras
6. L2 Regularization
